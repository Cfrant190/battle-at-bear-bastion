Battle at Bear Bastion is a 2D roguelite platformer where players take on the role of powerful bear warriors fighting through an ever-changing fortress. Each run consists of procedurally generated levels, alternating between dungeons, castle grounds, and the fortress walls. Players choose from distinct bear classes—such as a warrior, archer, or mage—each with a unique special ability and an ultimate ability fueled by “frenzy” collected from fallen foes.

Enemies grow stronger with each level, but they drop valuable items to aid in survival. Every 5th level brings a shopkeeper round, where players can buy upgrades, assign skill points, and even acquire legendary items—some of which may only appear through special mechanics.

The game emphasizes strategic progression, as players must choose between immediate power boosts and long-term skill tree investments. With randomized levels, escalating difficulty, and a mix of action and RPG elements, Battle at Bear Bastion offers high replayability and dynamic combat in a bear-driven fight for survival.
